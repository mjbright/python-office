Some experiments with Python-Excel and Python-Powerpoint modules

## Python and Excel

There are several Python modules available with different capabilities (different pros and cons).

For information about processing Excel files using Python refer to
- the Python-Excel site: http://www.python-excel.org/
- the Python-Excel Google Group: http://groups.google.com/group/python-excel
- The OpenPyXL Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openpyxl-users

**NOTE**: For invoking Python from within Excel you may want to look at [xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/), also an Open Source project (on [github](https://github.com/ZoomerAnalytics/xlwings).  It runs on Windows or macOS, but not on Linux.

## Python and Powerpoint

The python-pptx module allows to create Powerpoint files from Python.

Chris Moffitt wrote a nice Blog article about ["Creating Powerpoint Presentations with Python" - Aug 2015](http://pbpython.com/creating-powerpoint.html) including some intriguing examples.

It is an active project, for information refer to
- The documentation: https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- The PyPi page: https://pypi.org/project/python-pptx/
- The source code on Github: https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx
- Some examples in the documentation QuickStart page: https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html
